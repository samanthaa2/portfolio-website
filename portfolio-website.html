		<div class="text">Designed and developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website takes a minimalistic approach with greyscale images with grey overlays for each scrollable panel on the website, creating an aesthetically pleaseing, consistent theme throughout the site. It is enough for it to create good accents to each panel, without it causing a distraction.</div>
		<div class="text">It also uses a bright rainbow gradient throughout its design to give a contrast to the rest of the site, and provide it with colour.</div>
